# twine-typewriter-effect
assembles a typewriter effect for use in twine 2.x (Harlowe 3.x.x)

what's poppin gamers

welcome to my quick little bullshit snippet of code

so i was makin a thing in twine, right

and i wanted to make some words type themselves out

but that's not a macro

so i looked it up, did a few hours of research, and found that someone on the twine forums had posted a way to do this with a typed.js port into harlowe (typed.js is a typewriter effect kinda like this but it's actually well made and is used for stuff outside of some random-ass story maker thing)

unfortunately, there was no link to the forum post where he detailed the description and i couldn't go onto his profile to look for it because the forums had been archived

so i fucking made it myself

but worse

it's really dogshit ngl

anyways here's how it works

# instructions
1. install python and add it to your path

  *if you don't know how to do that then google it, it's not my fucking problem*
  
2. run the file

  *no shit*
  
3. paste in/write out what you want it to type

  *i made it capable of taking multi-line input. you just press enter as if you were typing normally*
  
4. on a new line, type *zqga* and press enter

  *that signifies to the program that you're done with the stuff you want to type out*
  
5. follow the directions in the program

  *input the time and shit, it's not that hard. it takes floats btw. also if you just press enter and don't input a value it assumes a value of 0*
  
6. paste the code

  *the program automatically copies the completed set of macros to your clipboard. all you have to do is paste it into twine and it works.*

7. press enter to close the program

  *it's not rocket science*

# what to do if there's a problem

dm me on discord i never check this shit
